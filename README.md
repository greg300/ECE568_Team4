## About
This repository includes code to represent a takeout & delivery management system for a restaurant, built with Google Firebase and Node.js.

## How to Run
1. Install Node.js (if not installed already) and Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`).

2. To deploy locally, run `npm run serve` from within "functions".

3. Use either `curl` (sample requests included in `curl_examples.txt`) or *Postman* (sample request collection included at `Food2Go.postman_collection.json`, can be imported into *Postman*) to test API functions.

4. View Firebase Realtime Database at https://console.firebase.google.com/project/food2go-56aac/database/food2go-56aac-default-rtdb/data (need to request access from one of the contributors).
